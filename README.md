# AGK-Examples
A collection of mini AGK projects that I've created, some were created for no reason other than being curious.

### Material Icons
This script contains all of the Material Icons converted for AGK use. There is a folder for each type i.e.: baseline, outlined, round, sharp, and twotone.

Change iconsPath$ to point to the set you want to use.

Two sizes for each set have been provided. 48px and 96px. The 96px is recommended if you're starting to notice blurry icons when scaling up the 48px version. Keep in mind that the 96px version will make your app a little larger because the image sizes are larger.

You can use these icons in OryUI if you want to replace the default icon set which is currently baseline 48px. If so, only copy and replace the *.png, and *.txt files from the desired style and size i.e. twotone/96px folder into media/OryUIMedia/Material-Icons. Don't copy the folder, just the files within it.

### Pixel Art To Sprite Art
This script contains a simple function that reads any image and converts it to pixel art built from coloured sprites. It works best with images that have large blocks of the same colour in i.e. a pixel art image, or an Arkanoid type game level screen.

#### What could it be used for?
Could be used for designing levels that use simple colour blocks laid out in a number of different designs.
