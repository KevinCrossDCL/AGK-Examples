# AGK-Examples
A collection of mini AGK projects that I've created, some were created for no reason other than being curious.

### Pixel Art To Sprite Art
This script contains a simple function that reads any image and converts it to pixel art built from coloured sprites. It works best with images that have large blocks of the same colour in i.e. a pixel art image, or an Arkanoid type game level screen.

#### What could it be used for?
Could be used for designing levels that use simple colour blocks laid out in a number of different designs.
